As of March 31 2015, the code should be mostly ready for django-1.7,
with the following restrictions

* migrations : django-1.7 comes with its own native migrations system
  and so south is not needed/recommended any longer. So for now we have a
  version of such native migrations that does a one-shot setup of a db
  schema but this is stored in

  portal/native_migrations

  instead of the standard location

  portal/migrations

  because this one is still expected to hold south code with earlier djangos
  You might need to rename native_migrations/ into migrations/ before
  running manage.py migrate in the first place

* testing quite a few issues related to 1.7 have been addressed but it
  would be presomptuous to state that things were tested very
  thoroughly, far from that.

  So please use with care and let meknow of any additional issues
