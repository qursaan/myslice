Dear {{first_name}} {{last_name}},

It is my pleasure to welcome you as a fully signed-up user of the OneLab experimental facility. OneLab provides you with access to world class computer networking testbeds, such as IoT-LAB, NITOS, and PlanetLab Europe. Our aim at OneLab is to promote the use of these testbeds for pre-commercial research and development by industry, for scientific research, and for university level laboratory exercises.

Your entry point for access to the testbeds is the OneLab portal, which provides a web-based interface for browsing and reserving resources on the various testbeds. To run an experiment using those resources, you may log in to the testbed and/or to individual nodes on the testbed with your OneLab public/private key pair, or you may use an experiment control tool such as as NEPI or OMF. The OneLab operations team is standing by at support@onelab.eu to provide you with help regarding the portal and to refer your testbed- and tool-specific queries to those best able to answer them.

On behalf of the entire team, I wish you a fruitful user experience with the OneLab portal.

Yours sincerely,

Timur Friedman
Executive Director
