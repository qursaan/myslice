Dear {{first_name}} {{last_name}},

It is my pleasure to welcome you as a fully signed-up user of the Fed4FIRE portal. Fed4FIRE provides you with access to world class computer networking testbeds. Our aim at Fed4FIRE is to promote the use of these testbeds for research and development by industry, for scientific research, and for university level laboratory exercises.

Your entry point for access to the testbeds is the Fed4FIRE portal, which provides a web-based interface for browsing and reserving resources on the various testbeds. To run an experiment using those resources, you may log in to the testbed and/or to individual nodes on the testbed with your Fed4FIRE public/private key pair, or you may use an experiment control tool such as as NEPI or OMF. TheFed4FIRE operations team is standing by at contact@fed4fire.eu to provide you with help regarding the portal and to refer your testbed- and tool-specific queries to those best able to answer them.

We wish you a fruitful user experience with the Fed4FIRE portal.

Yours sincerely,
The Fed4FIRE team
