			<p>
				Fed4FIRE Portal is a central place to get acess to all Fed4FIRE testbeds.In order to get access to the portal,
				an experimenter needs to  <a href="/portal/register">register</a> to the portal. The portal administrative body
				is responsible to accept or reject newly registered users.

 			<h3>A ready-made and easily customisable user interface for your testbed.</h3>
				<p>
					MySlice is an ambitious project aiming to support researchers throughout the lifecycle of experiments that can run on a variety 
					of testbeds spanning different administrative domains and networking technologies. Its basic principle is to bring together 
					available resources with useful information (characteristics, performance, network measurements).
				</p>
				<p>
					MySlice inititiave started in Janury 2011 by offering annotation services for the first ederated experimental resources. Today, 
					MySlice has taken a big step toward becoming a tand-alone web framework, which will present all available resources from testbeds 
					across the world, interconnected through the Slice-based Facility Architecture (SFA) and annotated by the TopHat measurement system.
				</p>
				<p>
					Our framework is built with standard programming tools (python and javascript for the front-end and python for the back-end) 
					and has a modular structure based on the concept of plugins for implementing different core functionalities (query editing, 
					data display, and resource allocation).
				</p>
				<p>
					The goal is to enable developers with expertise on different testbed technologies and different experimental 
					practices to work in parallel for optimizing the tools presented to the users allowing them for a wide range of choices 
					according to their own requirements. Opening in this way the development of web-based user tools for experimentation and 
					sharing effort and information can increase significantly the chances for the achievement of our challenging objective.

			<h3>Portal Components</h3>
				<h5>Myslice (Web Frontend)</h5>
					<p>
						A full-fledged and modular web portal for a testbed federation allowing user to register, 
						request slices and browse and book resources, with a strong emphasis on measurements.
					</p>
					<p> More Info: <a href="http://myslice.info/" target="_blank">http://myslice.info/</a></p>
					<p> Code: <a href="http://git.onelab.eu/?p=myslice.git;a=summary" target="_blank">Git Repository</a> (read only)</p> 
					<p> 
						If you need write access to the git repository you need first to send your public key to <a href="mailto:support@onelab.eu">support@onelab.eu</a>.
					</p>


				<h5>Manifold (Portal backend)</h5>
					<p>
						Manifold is the backend that is running behind the portal. It is a component allowing the integration of distributed 
						and heterogeneous data sources, such as measurement platforms or data repositories.
					</p>
